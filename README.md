# Opendistro-app chart

Giant Swarm offers a Opendistro Managed App which can be installed in tenant clusters.
Here we define the Opendistro chart with its templates and default configuration.

This application is intended to have a centralized log storage for your applications, it's not meant to be long term storage and is prepared to delete old indexes (7 days by default)


## Features
- OpenDistro Elasticsearch with security enabled
- Transport certificates autogenerated for 5 years
- **Curator will delete indices older than 7 days**
- Fluentd will collect all logs from pods **not** deployed in the namespaces: default, giantswarm, opendistro-app, kube-node-lease, kube-public and kube-system.

## Additional information

- If you change the name of the helm release from "opendistro-app" to "logging-stack" you will need to adapt default configuration and change all references of "opendistro-app-opendistro-es-client-service" to "logging-stack-opendistro-es-client-service" in the [values file](./helm/opendistro-app/values.yaml)

## Components

### OpenDistro
OSS Elasticsearch distribution
(Additional info)[./helm/opendistro-app/charts/opendistro-es/README.md]

### OpenDistro Certificate Generator
Generates the certificates to start OpenDistro in a secure way. It will create a rootCA and the certificate that will be used to stablish communications between nodes.
(Additional info)[./helm/opendistro-app/charts/opendistro-certs/README.md]

### ElasticSearch Exporter
Exposes Prometheus metrics that can be explored wit https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/2322
(Additional info)[./helm/opendistro-app/charts/elasticsearch-exporter/README.md]

### ElasticSearch Curator
Manages ElasticSearch indexes lifecycle, by default is configured to delete indices older than 7 days
(Additional info)[./helm/opendistro-app/charts/elasticsearch-curator/README.md]

### FluentD
Log collector and parser that will send pod logs to ElasticSearch.
(Additional info)[./helm/opendistro-app/charts/fluentd/README.md]


## Configuration

This chart is composed of multiple helm charts and each can be configured from a single values file with the following format:

``` 
opendistro-certs:
  Check ./helm/opendistro-app/charts/opendistro-certs/values.yaml

elasticsearch-curator:
  Check ./helm/opendistro-app/charts/elasticsearch-curator/values.yaml

elasticsearch-exporter:
  Check ./helm/opendistro-app/charts/elasticsearch-exporter/values.yaml

fluentd:
  Check ./helm/opendistro-app/charts/fluentd/values.yaml

opendistro-es:
  Check ./helm/opendistro-app/charts/opendistro-es/values.yaml
```

Check [deafult values file](./helm/opendistro-app/values.yaml) for all components. 

This configuration has been tuned by our team to give sane defaults for all components and modifying the internal_users.yaml file should be enough in most cases.

## Example Configurations

[AWS Example Configuration](./example_values/ingress_enabled_aws.yaml)

    Do not use in production, just for testing

    Default user: admin/admin

[Azure Example Configuration](./example_values/ingress_enabled_aws.yaml)

    Do not use in production, just for testing

    Default user: admin/admin

[Security Configuration](./example_values/security_config.yaml)

    Modify internal_users.yml before deploying the application

    Default user: admin/test
    
    You will need to create additional resources in kubernetes to make it more secure:

        $ kubectl create secret generic -n opendistro opendistro-security-config --from-file=config_examples/config.yml
        $ kubectl create secret generic -n opendistro opendistro-internal-users --from-file=config_examples/internal_users.yml

    You need to change the password values in internal_users.yml file and adjust the values in security_config.yaml accordingly.
