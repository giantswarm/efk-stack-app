# OpenDistro certificate generator

Generates CA needed to enable OpenDistro security pluguin with [certstrap](https://github.com/square/certstrap).

The rootCA and the transport certificates will be stored in kubernetes secrets using a Job to create the initial certificates and a cronjob to constantly check that the certificates are present.

If you wish to renew certificates you just can delete the kubernetes secret and they will be generated again.

**Certificate renewal is not implemented**
